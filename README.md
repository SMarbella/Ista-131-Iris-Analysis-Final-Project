# ISTA 131: Iris Analysis Final Project
The dataset I used to generate my charts is the Iris Data Set from Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) by R. A. Fisher. The dataset has 50 samples of three iris species. The three iris species are Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. Each of the flowers have unique traits correlated with their species. The program creates three charts.
One function takes an iris DataFrame and creates a bar chart that displays the variations between the sepal and petal lengths in cm of the three iris species.
The second function takes an iris DataFrame and creates a scatters plot with the linear regressions for each iris species. The scatter plot records the sepal widths and lengths for each flower species in cm.
The third function takes an iris DataFrame and creates a scatter plot with the linear regressions for each iris species. The scatter plot records the petal widths and lengths for each flower species in cm.
